### Key Points:

- Manchester United decide to replace Ten Hag
- Manager will leave even if he wins FA Cup
- Kieran McKenna and Mauricio Pochettino are top targets

### WHAT HAPPENED?

Ten Hag will take charge of Manchester United for a final time at Wembley on Saturday in the FA Cup final as the Dutchman will depart the club this summer, according to Gianluca Di Marzio, via SoccerNews.nl. The Red Devils are already on the lookout for a new manager and will make a change even if Ten Hag masterminds an FA Cup final win over Manchester City.

### THE BIGGER PICTURE

Ten Hag's future has become uncertain after a difficult campaign for the Red Devils. United finished the season down in eighth place in the Premier League table, with a negative goal difference, and will only play European football next season if they beat City in the final. Manchester United have already been linked with a move for Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna as well as England manager Gareth Southgate if Ten Hag does depart Old Trafford after the cup final. Former Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel and freshly unemployed Mauricio Pochettino are also thought to be in the frame.

### WHAT DI MARZIO SAID

Di Marzio said: "McKenna is the man of the moment in the football world, in the world of coaches, because he is doing great at Ipswich Town. He is the number one choice at Brighton & Hove Albion, but he has also already spoken to Manchester United. At the end of the season, United will say goodbye to Ten Hag.

â€œManchester United will also be looking for a new coach. And their targets are McKenna and Mauricio Pochettino. De Zerbi is also on the list, but he has not been in contact with United in recent days. If he [McKenna] goes to Chelsea, United will go for Pochettino. But what is certain: they are saying goodbye to Ten Hag."
